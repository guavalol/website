    Alfred Hitchcock Biography
  </a>
    <h2>Alfred Hitchcock</h2>
      <p>Hitchcock's filming style is one that is influential for many simply because he preferred to let visuals tell the story in his films rather than have a dialogue convey the emotions and moods of the films.an example of this is in psycho when he shows the murder without any dialogue. another way that he would make use of his <a href="https://indiefilmhustle.com/hitchcock-create-suspense/" title="cinematography">cinematography</a>
         style was by creating suspense at just the right time so that the audience would never know what was coming next. The last technique that I'll be writing about is the use of subjectivity that Hitchcock would use to make it seem like the female lead of his movies would seem to be feeling the same thing that the audience would be feeling while watching the specific scenes.
