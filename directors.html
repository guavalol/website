      <p>Hitchcock's filming style is one that is influential for many simply because he preferred to <strong>let visuals tell the story in his films rather than have a dialogue convey the emotions and moods of the films</strong>.an example of this is in psycho when he shows the murder without any dialogue. another way that he would make use of his

         style was by creating suspense at just the right time so that the audience would never know what was coming next. The last technique that I'll be writing about is the use of subjectivity that Hitchcock would use to make it seem like the female lead of his movies would seem to be feeling the same thing that the audience would be feeling while watching the <em>specific</em> scenes.

    <p>Carpenter is widely known in the horror movie community. One of the many things that he does is tell the viewer what the movies about in that most of his films have the title as a monster. Technique two is that he has a way of creating unsettling atmospheres, for instance, in Halloween, where he makes it known that Michael Myers is thereby having him standing menacingly in the background. He also has produced some of the music for his movies himself as he is a <a href="https://theofficialjohncarpenter.com/" title="composer">composer</a>.
